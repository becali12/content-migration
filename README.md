# content_structure_script

Script used to create folder structure and modify links present in existing articles, in order to help with the content migration to Docusaurus.

For the script to work, you'll need to create a google sheet with the following format, and create a .json file containing the private key required for accessing the sheet via api. (see ![this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu5wXjz2KvU))
